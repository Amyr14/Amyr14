# About
My name is Amyr Allan, I'm a CS undergrad at UDESC (Santa Catarina's State University). My areas of interest are formal languages (automatas, compilers) and image processing, but I hold no prejudice with other computer science fields and I enjoy studying and learning about all of them. 
I take joy in learning new things and starting new and exciting projects. If you have an interesting idea and you want a hand, feel free to contact me by email or linkedIn!
